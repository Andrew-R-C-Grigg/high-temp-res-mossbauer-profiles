Nussbaum: Code to collect and analyse high temperature-resolution Mössbauer spectroscopy profiles

Status: Under Development / Pre-publication


Overview

This repository contains the source code and analysis scripts associated with the study of high temperature-resolution Mössbauer profiles. This code is designed to automate the collection of Mössbauer spectra at a user-defined temperature resolution, and automate the fitting of hyperfine parameters at all temperatures simultaneously.

Repository Content

Currently, this repository is a placeholder. Upon publication of the accompanying article, it will be updated to include:

    Scripts: Python code used for data collection and data processing.

    Documentation: Instructions for reproducing the analysis.

    Sample Data: Example files to test the profile fitting, as shown in the linked article
